# pythonBasics (work in progress)

This repository will consist of a compilation of Python-related tasks and readings to develop a foundation with the language; allowing you to use OOP concepts in conjuntion with various libraries to create projects that will allow you to hook up an ELEGOO Arduino R3 and create visual simulations of inputted data from the device; circuit diagrams and instructions on the hardware side will be provided

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are new to the git workflow (like me), this will also work as an excellent form of practice to get comfortable with it, and I will link resources for good writing habits. You may also fork this repository and create your own solutions to the tasks you will be alloted and compare them to mine (which will be in separate) folder, but do not make a pull request for no good reason; that would only waste time for the both of us...
